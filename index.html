                <h1> The Impact of Gaming on Our Actions and Attitudes </h1>
                <h2> by Vincent Nguyen </h2>
                <p>
                    Video games have created a huge revolution in the way that people find entertainment, 
                    and many may feel as though their lives have been impacted by games in some way.
                    There are arguments against playing games, claiming that they brew violence in the world and may be a cause for lack of sleep.
                    However, there are also testimonies that gaming benefits us more than it harms us, 
                    saying that playing games heightens our mental capacity and improves our hand-eye coordination skills.
                    This project is meant to give insight into both sides of the argument and to play through scenarios
                    in which games both harm as well as aid someone.
                </p>
                <p> The following are hypothetical situations based on actual events.</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="#scene1"> Proceed to Scenario 1 </a>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!--<div class="border"></div>-->
        <div class="scene" id="scene1">
            <div class="container">
                <h1> Scenario 1 </h1>
                <h3> It is 11:00 PM. Vincent is feeling tired but has an assignment that is due tomorrow. 
                Unfortunately, he has not made much progress due to his gaming habits.
                He estimates that it would take about 2-3 hours to complete the assignment, not counting breaks. </h3>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <h2> Situation 1: </h2>
                        <p> Vincent goes to bed, hoping to get enough rest so that he might be able to finish up early tomorrow morning. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <h2> Situation 2: </h2>
                        <p> Vincent attempts to power through the assignment and pull off an "all-nighter." He falls asleep right after he finishes the assignment, around 2 AM. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h2> Result </h2>
                    <p> In both situations, Vincent will likely become stressed and will not be able to put forth his best work. 
                    The first situation would create a great deal of pressure to fit in work at the last minute, 
                    while the second situation may cause him to feel groggy when waking up the next morning, 
                    impeding his ability to learn the next day. </p> <br>
                    <p style="text-align: right;">
                        <a href="#scene2"> Next </a>

            <div class="container">
                <h1> Scenario 2 </h1>
                <h3> There is a social event taking place at school on the weekend. Vincent has two options: either he musters up the courage to spend money on the event in the hope of spending time with others,
                or he stays at home and plays video games for entertainment instead. </h3>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <h2> Situation 1: </h2>
                        <p> Vincent buys a ticket and goes to the event. Lacking much of a social life, he tries to stick around his closest friends. 
                        However, he is often ignored and is left feeling like he could have enjoyed himself if he had stayed home. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <h2> Situation 2: </h2>
                        <p> Vincent stays at home and plays video games the entire weekend. 
                        Upon the start of the next week, though, he regrets not going to the event and believes that he could have had a more memorable experience if he had gone. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h2> Result </h2>
                    <p>
                        One could argue that it would be best for Vincent to attend the event, and attempt to improve his social life. 
                        In the situation described, it seems as though gaming has negatively impacted Vincent's attitude as he is socially awkward and is unable to interact much with others.
                        If we suppose that Vincent tried to reach out in every possible way and was still rejected, it can be inferred that gaming had a poor influence on Vincent's life.

                <h3> It's your turn to decide. Vincent has been procrastinating on an important assignment, which is due in 3 days. However, there are workshops taking place each of the days leading up to the due date.
                Vincent thinks that he might not have time to work on the assignment if he attends these workshops, but believes that what he will learn in the workshops may be beneficial. <br>

                            Attend the workshops, perhaps they will provide tips to help to complete the assignment quicker. They'll also be useful in for future reference.
