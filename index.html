                <h1> The Impact of Gaming on Our Actions and Attitudes </h1>
                <h2> by Vincent Nguyen </h2>
                <p>
                    Video games have created a huge revolution in the way that us people find entertainment, 
                    and I'm here to tell a story about how the life of a gamer might pan out.
                    There are arguments against playing games, as they brew violence in the world and may be a cause for lack of sleep,
                    as well as testimonies that gaming benefits us more than it harms us, 
                    saying that playing games heightens our mental capacity and improves our hand-eye coordination skills.
                    This website is meant to give insight into both sides of the argument and to play through scenarios
                    in which games both harm as well as aid someone.
                </p>
                <p> The following are hypothetical situations that are based on actual events.</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="#scene1"> Proceed to Scenario 1 </a>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="border"></div>
        <div class="scene" id="scene1">
            <div class="container">
                <h1> Scenario 1 </h1>
                <h3> It is 11:00 PM. Vincent is feeling tired but has an assignment that is due tomorrow. 
                Unfortunately, he has not made much progress due to his gaming habits.
                He estimates that it would take about 2-3 hours to complete the assignment, not counting breaks. </h3>
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <h2> Situation 1: </h2>
                        <p> Vincent goes to bed, hoping to get enough rest so that he might be able to finish up early tomorrow morning. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <h2> Situation 2: </h2>
                        <p> Vincent attempts to power through the assignment and pull off an "all-nighter." He falls asleep right after he finishes the assignment, around 2 AM. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h2> Result </h2>
                    <p> In both situations, Vincent will likely become stressed and will not be able to put forth his best work. 
                    The first situation would create a great deal of pressure to fit in work at the last minute, 
                    while the second situation may cause him to feel groggy when waking up the next morning, 
                    impeding his ability to learn the next day. </p> <br>
