                <h1> The Impact of Gaming on Our Actions and Attitudes </h1>
                <h2> by Vincent Nguyen </h2>
                <p>
                    Video games have created a huge revolution in the way that people find entertainment, 
                    and many may feel as though their lives have been impacted by games in some way.
                    There are arguments against playing games, claiming that they brew violence in the world and may be a cause for lack of sleep.
                    However, there are also testimonies that gaming benefits us more than it harms us, 
                    saying that playing games heightens our mental capacity and improves our hand-eye coordination skills.
                    This project is meant to give insight into both sides of the argument and to play through scenarios
                    in which games both harm as well as aid someone.
                </p>
                <p> The following are hypothetical scenarios based on actual events. 
                Read through and decide which options presented are the ones that you believe are the best ones to make in each scenario.
                Then view the 'Result' for analysis on each scenario. </p>
