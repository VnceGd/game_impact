                    The original plan for this project was to create a game or app that would play through the hypothetical life of a gamer. The game would allow the player to manage time spent within the game, which would hopefully help them to manage time in their actual lives. With a week remaining and very little work put together, it was clear that it would not be finished by the time it was due and the project changed to putting together a website. With the initial ideas put together already, and previous knowledge of creating a site, it was not too difficult to conjure up a rough draft of the project. However, the first draft of the project was very basic, and set the layout of the site with a single scenario. After feedback from peers, minor tweaks were made to the look of the website and new content was added. At first, the scenarios were simply laid out in a way that provided the scenario and two situations that may occur, with a result block explaining the outcomes of both situations. This was updated so that the viewer would be able to choose an option for each scenario and view the results for each, as well as a general conclusion. By the day before the project was due, the site contained three scenarios, with two showing negative impacts of gaming, and one presenting a way that gaming is beneficial. A feedback form was created to get an opinion of the product produced by the due date of the project, but most of the advice from the discussion forum was key to building the site, as suggestions about the navigation system, style, and interactivity were implemented.

                    The goal of the site is to provide various scenarios that could possibly come up in the life of an average gamer and allow the viewer to assess different options that could be taken in each case. It is meant to give a general picture of how gaming may impact decisions and behaviors, and provide brief analysis on the different situations that may occur during the life of a gamer as well as possible responses in each scenario.

                    The project is directed at a general audience, so the design of the website and ease of navigation was an important factor. It is more specifically targeted at gamers, though, who may have had similar experiences to those described in the scenarios. Hopefully these people will be influenced in some way by the analysis provided, and reflect on how gaming may have had an impact in their lives.

                    My philosophy is that there are many people who may be influenced by gaming and of those people, there may be a number that do not realize how they are affected. I believe that the understanding of the positive and negative impacts of gaming may help to better manage oneâ€™s time in order to maintain a healthy balance between work and play.

                    The final result of the project as of Thursday, October 27, is a site containing a brief introduction of the topic, and a presentation of three interactive scenarios which the viewer is meant to read through to gain an understanding of possible decisions made by a gamer in hypothetical situations. It ends with a conclusion summarizing pros and cons of gaming as well as a feedback form for future reference.
